New changes with this commit.
-added delivered attribute to stock_order
    New Logic: Peter makes the outgoing order by filling in a stock order, when the order 
    is delivered all the staff member has to do is mark it as delivered.
    
-added occupied attribute to enclosure 
    New Logic: If the enlosure already exists but isnt occupied, you dont have to enter in loads
    of prompts to create and fill this info out, you just need to enter in the enclosure id of
    an empty kennel.
    
****See the word document for more details on how my bit works.***

We will have to get the ERD up to date tomorrow, fix up your disease bit and 
get the permissions sorted then we are done. This all makes sense to me now 
after them small changes........ I think.
